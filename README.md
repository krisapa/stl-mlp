# Minimal Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

> Only using the C++ STL (standard template library).

Ported a python implementation of a neural network from scratch to C++ using the STL. It was just a fun opportunity to practice C++ and learn more about neural networks.

## Compilation & Usage
To build and run the project, use:

```bash
make run
```

### Result

The network with cross-validation performs well on the dataset:
